# Coding Challenges Solutions

This repo is made to solve [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro/) by John Crickett

I will solve them one by one when I have time

Taking the ones have the [Beginners](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/tags/beginner/) tag firstly then going to other ones.

I will use Typescript as my main language, if any other language needed in some project then I will use it and point out to this in the project README.
